## Geospatial Clustering Analysis using H3 Library

This project focuses on utilizing clustering techniques on geospatial data, specifically targeting commercial locations and anonymized mobile device data in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina. The aim is to uncover patterns and insights that can inform decision-making processes.

### Dataset Overview
1. **mobile_data_cordoba.csv**: An anonymized dataset containing mobile devices along with timestamp information.
2. **population_2010.geojson**: Official population data from 2010.
3. **ICV_argentina.geojson**: Data on the Socioeconomic Level Index (ICV) ranging from 1 to 10, where 1 represents the highest socioeconomic level.
4. **locations_cordoba.csv**: Geospatial data represented by H3 level 9 hexagons, defining the influence zone for intersection with mobile devices.

### Analysis Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the datasets.
   - Merge relevant datasets based on spatial and temporal attributes.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculate unique devices per H3 level 9 hexagon.
   - Analyze device movement across hexagons to understand cannibalization.
   - Estimate population density and socioeconomic level around commercial locations.

3. **Clustering**:
   - Utilize the H3 library for spatial clustering of commercial locations and mobile device data.
   - Explore various clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering.
   - Evaluate clustering results using appropriate metrics (e.g., silhouette score, elbow method).

4. **Interpretation and Visualization**:
   - Visualize clusters on maps to understand spatial distribution.
   - Provide detailed insights into each cluster's characteristics.
   - Explain the rationale behind variable selection and the determination of the number of clusters.

### Additional Considerations
- **External Data Sources**: While external data sources are not expected to be incorporated, potential additional data sources or variables that could enhance the analysis can be explored.
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of the codebase, including explanations of functions and methodologies used.
- **Presentation**: Prepare a comprehensive presentation summarizing the exploratory process, clustering results, and insights derived from the analysis.
